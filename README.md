## [View the live project here.](https://saleh88hbg.github.io/KingBurgerClub-MS1/)


## User Experience (UX)

I have designed this webpage using HTML and CSS, the UX was kept clean whit purpose to drag attention on making a booking.
The website is responsive and user friendly and easy to understand the purpose of the site.
I've included the feature of social media links on the footer section so one can navigate directly to the social media pages of the company 
and ggoogle map is deployed to our visiting address (fixed address).

## Technologies Used

### Languages

[HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
Was used for the overall structure of the website.

[CSS3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets)
Was used for styling the elements and content on the website.

### Frameworks, IDE, Libraries and Programs

[Google Fonts:](https://fonts.google.com/) - 
Google fonts were used to import the 'Barlow Condensed' font into the style.css file which is used on all pages throughout the project.

[GitHub:](https://github.com/)
GitHub was used to store the projects code after being pushed from Git.

[Gitpod:](https://www.gitpod.io/)
Was used to develop and write my project and push all commits through integrated "git" to Github.

## Content

The content (Menu, About) on the page was written by me "Saleh Chehade".
The contact and map location is a "fixed address".

## Testing W3C

The W3C Html Validator and W3C CSS Validator Services were used to validate the code. 
No errors were found in the code, only few warnings were the W3C html consider that heading elements need to be continued.

### Features Left to Implement

In a near future I would like to implement:

To complete that i need to learn more programming languages to make the website more interactive and functional.

## Tools and editors:
